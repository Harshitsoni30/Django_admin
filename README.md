# Django_Model_for_chatbot
## Overview
This project is an admin dashboard designed to manage prompt templates, agents, and model configurations for a medicine suggestion chatbot. The chatbot itself runs on **FastAPI** and uses **Gemini/OpenAI LLMs** to generate intelligent, safe responses based on curated medical references. This Django application helps structure and maintain the backend logic and knowledge used by the chatbot.

## Features
- Provides management of medicine-related prompts, models, and agent metadata.
- Uses structured datasets from medical references and pharmaceutical knowledge.
- Built with **Django** for a powerful admin interface and scalable backend.
